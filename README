The nursesGowersPreProcessing file uses the nursery dataset provided. The program nominally looks at the dataset and implements gowers distance to conduct agglomerative clustering. Multiple types of Agglomerative linkage are used, and the silhouette scores for the overall clustering algorithm are calculated. 

The hmsPreprocess works with the national20212022_PUBLIC_instchars.csv dataset (not included) from the HMS dataset. It attempts to calculate the gowers distance for the dataset, but currently is running into issues regarding space - the dataset is a large one. 

The gowers.py file uses the Dartmouth - Courses.csv dataset provided. It imputes missing data using KNN clusters, verifying that the impuations are reasonable through a plot of distributions before and after distributions. The program also displays heatmaps to visually analyze the locations and type of missing values. It calculates gowers distance to increase the accuracy of imputation for the categorical columns (also using KNN Imputing). Finally, it attempts to use K-Prototypes to cluster the data (after first determining the optimal number of clusters through the elbow method). However, the code runs into errors in K-prototypes that are still being worked on.
